		<h2>About</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>I'm a designer &amp; developer living in Arizona, currently looking for work.</p>
		<p>I am constantly reading, watching, and writing different projects to help improve my knowledge and my own projects in the future. I enjoy making things from scratch, having an idea and being able to just make it into something others can use and see is amazing to me. My goal is to just simply design and develop projects people will use and enjoy.</p>
